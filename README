# FS: a network flow record generator

FS is a network flow record generator.  It contains a discrete event
simulation core to generate the flow records, and relies on existing 
TCP throughput models to drive the simulation.

FS is made available under terms of the GPLv2.

# Building fs

FS is implemented in Python and has a few external module dependencies:

To use fs, you need the following Python packages:
 * ipaddr (2.1.1)
 * networkx (1.0)
 * pydot (1.0.2)
 * pyparsing (1.5.2)
 * pytricia (also can use py-radix 0.5)

Versions above indicate those that I've tested with.  

Pytricia is my own code, also available on github.  It's faster than existing
Python modules for doing IP lookup, and as a bonus is Py3k compatible.

Better documentation will be added as time permits.
