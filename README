# FS: a network flow record generator

FS is a network flow record generator.  It contains a discrete event
simulation core to generate the flow records, and relies on existing 
TCP throughput models to drive the simulation.

FS is made available under terms of the GPLv2.

# Building fs

FS is implemented in Python and has a few external module dependencies:

To use fs, you need the following Python packages:
 * ipaddr 
 * networkx 
 * pydot 
 * pyparsing 
 * pytricia (py-radix is no longer supported)

To install all the above, see the requirements.txt file here and use pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

I'd recommend using virtualenv, then installing the packages using
pip, inside a given venv.  See http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv.

Better documentation will be added as time permits.
