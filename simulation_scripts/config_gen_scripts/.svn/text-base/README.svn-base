# This folder contains scripts to generate different data center topologies and create shortest path routes in the network

# The script below creates data center topologies: tree, fattree, complete graph.
# It takes as input the topology name: topologyname(e.g, tree)  k(switch degree) N(no of switches)
# The output is a topology file, in the form of links in the network

perl createdcntopo.pl tree 8 0



# The script below creates short path routes given a topology file
# Takes as input the topology file from the previous script and the outputfile which contains the routes between every pair of top of the rack switch


perl routingdcn.pl  tree8 routingtree8


# The script below creates jellfish topology and our own fso-based dynamic topology
# input: k(# of servers) D(flexible degree) C(# of steiner switches) R(# of racks) outputfile inputtraffic_matrix

# The script below creates multiple short path routes given a topology file
# Takes as input the topology file from the previous script and the outputfile which contains the routes between every pair of top of the rack switch
