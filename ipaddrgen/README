This is code for dynamically and efficiently generating realistic IPv4
addresses for simulation purposes.  See our SIMUtools 2011 paper for details
on the method, available at: http://cs.colgate.edu/faculty/jsommers

This code is _alpha_ quality.  There are many things that need to be
improved about it, most notably the ability to avoid generating addresses
from RFC1918 space (unless one is using a prefix from that space).  

To build:
python setup.py build

To install:
python setup.py install

The file trietest.py gives a short example of how to use the code
from Python.  The file testmain.c gives an example of how to use it
from C.
